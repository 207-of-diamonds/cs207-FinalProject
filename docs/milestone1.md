## Introduction
*Describe the problem the software solves and why it's important to solve that problem*

## Background
*Describe (briefly) the mathematical background and concepts as you see fit. You **do not** need to give a treatise on automatic differentiation or dual numbers. Just give the essential ideas (e.g. the chain rule, the graph structure of calculations, elementary functions, etc.). Do not copy and paste any of the lecture notes.*

## How to Use *PackageName*
*How do you envision that a user will interact with your package? What should they import? How can they instantiate AD objects?*

## Software Organization
*Discuss how you plan on organizing your software package*
- *What will the directory structure look like?*
- *What modules do you plan on including? What is their basic functionality?*
- *Where will your test suite live? Will you use TravisCI? CodeCov?
- *How will you distribute your package (e.g. PyPI)?*
- *How will you package your software? Will you use a framework? If so, which one and why? If not, why not?


## Implementation
Discuss how you plan on implementing the forward mode of automatic differentiation.
- *What are the core data structures?*
- *What classes will you implement?*
- *What method and name attributes will your classes have?*
- *What external dependencies will you rely on?*
- *How will you deal with elementary functions like sin, sqrt, log, and exp (and all the others)?*
